<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
-->
<!--
Here's a blank template to get started: To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following: `github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `linkedin_username`, `email_client`, `email`, `project_title`, `project_description`

-->

The primary goal of this project is to exercise with Argo CD based [GitOps](https://gitops.tech) deployment covering the full cycle - up to production via promotion, if you want to. Experimentation and production should not conflict.

The change process starts at localhost. Hence, we consider `kind` experience very important. Given that, some elements may be useful in CI context. Most things, should play nice  productive environments as well.

### Goals
- Speed : A fast cycle from localhost to production üöÄ 
- Fail early and loud (notifications)
- Scalability
- Simplicity (yes, really)
- Composability
- Target `kind`, vanilla `Kubernetes` and Openshift including `crc`

### Non Goals
### Decisions
We use a single long lived branch `main` and map environments with directories. Leveraging branches for environment propagation appears easy, but comes with its own set of issues. 

We use single level environment staging with one cluster per environment. We do not use names and namespaces in this context. This should help with isolation, loose coupling, support the cattle model and keep things simpler. We want cluster scoped staging. Using another nested level introduces issues ("Matrjoschka Architecture").

Following the App of Apps pattern, our `local` root `Application` is at (`envs/local`). The root app kicks off various `ApplicationSets` covering similarly shaped (e.g. `helm`/`kustomize`) apps hosted in [`apps`](./apps). Within that folder, we do not want Argo CD resources. This helps with separation and quick testing cycles. 


### Features

We cover deployments of:

- Argo CD (self managed)
- Argo CD Notifications
- Argo-CD Image-Updater
- Argo Rollouts
- Argo Events
- Operator Lifecycle Management
- Metallb
- Kube-Prometheus
- Loki/Promtail
- AWS Credentials Sync
- Sealed Secrets
- SOPS Secrets
- Submariner
- Caretta

-Beyond deployments, we feature:

- `mise` aiming at a more uniform environment locally and in CI
- `make` based tasks
- Github Actions integration

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Some opinions first:

- YAML at scale is ... terrible. Unfortunately, there is no way around.
- CI/CD usually comes with horrible DX : ‚Äú.. it‚Äôs this amalgamation of scripts in YAML tied together with duct tape.‚Äù
- Naming ... is hard
- Joining clusters is hard (e.g. Submariner)
- Beware of Magic üé©ü™Ñüê∞ (e.g. Argo CD helm release changes when Prometheus CRDs become available)
- Beware of helm shared values or kustomize base. We deploy `main` and shared bits kick in on all environments.
- Versions/Refs: Pin or Float? It depends. We should probably pin things in critical environments and keep things floating a bit more elsewhere
- We should propagate to production frequently.

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* `make`
* `kubectl` 
* `docker` (if using `kind`)
* `terraform` (optional)
* `helm` (if not using terraform) 

### Usage
For basic demo purposes, you can use this public repo. If you want to run against your own, replace the git server reference with your own.

First, you should choose where to start, specifically whether you want to use `terraform`.

If you don't want to use terraform, you should be starting at the root folder. There is a [`Makefile`](./Makefile) with various ad hoc tasks. Simply running

```sh
make
```

should give you some help.

If you want to use `terraform`, you'll start similarly in the [`./tf`](./tf) folder. The terraform module supports deployment to `kind` clusters.

Our preferred approach to secrets is sealed-secrets (have a look at [`gen-keys.sh`](./scripts/gen-keys.sh) in case you'd like to use `sops` instead).

If using github, you may want to disable github actions and/or add a public deployment key. 

```
gh repo deploy-key add ...
```

In the root folder (w/o terraform), you should be checking

```
make -n argocd-helm-install-basic argocd-apply-root
```

Run this without `-n` once you feel confident to get the ball rolling.

The default `local` deployment will deploy a [SealedSecret](./apps/infra/private/). It will fail during decryption, because we won't be sharing our key. It is meant to be used with Argo Notifications, so it is not critical for a basic demo. Feel free to introduce your own bootstrap secret. 


We want lifecycle of things (Create/Destroy) to be as fast as possible. Pulling images can slow things down significantly. Contrary docker a host based solution (such as `k3s`), challenges are harder with `kind`. Make sure to understand your the defails of your painpoints before implementing your solution.

- [Local Registry](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/local-registry/)
- [Pull-through Docker registry on Kind clusters](https://maelvls.dev/docker-proxy-registry-kind/) (`registry:2` supports only one registry per instnance)
- `kind load` may address some use cases
- Remove everything in `kind` installed by Argo CD (so we can rebuild from cached images). (s. `make argocd-destroy`)

<!-- TODO -->
## TODO
<!--
- [ ] Feature 1

- There are `TODO` tags in code (to provide context)
- `terraform` within Argo CD? (just like in `tf-controller`)
- crossplane
- keycloak + sso (DNS) local trickery
- `notify-send` desktop notifications (via webhook)
- Aspire Dashboard? (ultralight oTel)
- Customer Use Case Demo litmus? Should probably bring the pure chaos bits to Argo CD [`deas/kaos`](https://github.com/deas/ka0s/)

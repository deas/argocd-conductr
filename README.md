## About The Project

<!--
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
-->
<!--
Here's a blank template to get started: To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following: `github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `linkedin_username`, `email_client`, `email`, `project_title`, `project_description`

-->

The primary goal of this project is to exercise with Argo CD based [GitOps](https://gitops.tech) deployment covering the full cycle - up to production via promotion, if you want to. Experimentation and production should not conflict.

The change process starts at localhost. Hence, we consider `kind` experience very important. Given that, some elements may be useful in CI context. Most things, should play nice  productive environments as well.

### Goals

- Speed : A fast cycle from localhost to production üöÄ
- Fail early and loud (notifications)
- Scalability
- Simplicity (yes, really)
- Composability
- Target `kind`, vanilla `Kubernetes` and Openshift including `crc`

### Non Goals

### Decisions

We use a single long lived branch `main` and map environments with directories. Leveraging branches for environment propagation appears easy, but comes with its own set of issues.

We use single level environment staging with one cluster per environment. We do not use names and namespaces in this context, and we don't even dare to do multi-tenancy in a single cluster (OLMv1 drops it). This should help with isolation, loose coupling, support the cattle model and keep things simpler. We want cluster scoped staging. Using another nested level introduces issues ("Matrjoschka Architecture").

We prefer Pull over Push.

We focus on one "Platform Team" managing many clusters using a single repo. It should enable ArgoCD embedding for Application verticals.  

Following the App of Apps pattern, our `local` root `Application` is at (`envs/local`). The root app kicks off various `ApplicationSets` covering similarly shaped (e.g. `helm`/`kustomize`) apps hosted in [`apps`](./apps). Within that folder, we do not want Argo CD resources. This helps with separation and quick testing cycles.

OLM footprint has a bigger footprint than helm and it comes with its own set of issues as well. It is higher level and way more user friendly. With some components (e.g. Argo CD, Loki, LVM)  `helm` is the second class citizen. With others (e.g. Rook), it's the opposite. We prefer first class citizens. Hence, we default  to bring in OLM when it is not there initially (such as on `kind`).

### Features

We cover deployments of:

- Argo CD (self managed)
- Argo CD Notifications
- Argo-CD Image-Updater
- Argo Rollouts
- Argo Events
- Operator Lifecycle Management
- Metallb
- Kube-Prometheus
- Loki/Promtail
- Velero
- Cert-Manager
- AWS Credentials Sync
- Sealed Secrets
- SOPS Secrets
- Submariner
- Caretta
- LitmusChaos

Beyond deployments, we feature:

- `mise` aiming at a more uniform environment locally and in CI
- `make` based tasks
- Github Actions integration
- Prometheus Rule Unit Testing
- A [bare bones alerting application](./apps/infra/monitoring-webhook) in case want to send alerts to very custom receivers (like Matrix Chat Rooms)
- Open Cluster Management / Submariner Hub and Spoke Setup (WIP)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Some opinions first:

- YAML at scale is ... terrible. Unfortunately, there is no way around.
- CI/CD usually comes with horrible DX: ‚Äú.. it‚Äôs this amalgamation of scripts in YAML tied together with duct tape.‚Äù
- CI/CD should enable basic inner loop local development. Should not be `git commit -m hoping-for-the-best && git push`
- Naming ... is hard
- Joining clusters is hard (e.g. Submariner)
- Beware of Magic üé©ü™Ñüê∞ (e.g. Argo CD helm release changes when Prometheus CRDs become available)
- Beware of helm shared values or kustomize base. We deploy `main` and shared bits kick in on all environments.
- Versions/Refs: Pin or Float? It depends. We should probably pin things in critical environments and keep things floating a bit more elsewhere
- Don't try too hard modeling deps and ordering. Failing to start a few times can be perfectly fine. Honor this modeling your alerts.
- We should propagate to production frequently.
- Rebuilding whole things automatically from scratch matters a lot. Drift kicks in fast and it helps with Recovery.
- Bootstrapping OLM is painful - thanks god, there is a [helm chart](https://github.com/CloudTooling/k8s-olm) these days.
- Using Kubernetes bits in Terraform (e.g. `helm`, `kustomize`, `kubectl`, `kubernetes` providers), only use the bare minimum (because deps are painful)
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- `make`
- `kubectl`
- `mise` (highly recommended)
- `docker` (if using `kind`)
- `terraform` (optional)
- `helm` (if not using terraform)

### Usage

For basic demo purposes, you can use this public repo. If you want to run against your own, replace the git server reference with your own.

First, you should choose where to start, specifically whether you want to use `terraform`.

If you don't want to use terraform, you should be starting at the root folder. There is a [`Makefile`](./Makefile) with various ad hoc tasks. Simply running

```sh
make
```

should give you some help.

If you want to use `terraform`, you'll start similarly in the [`./tf`](./tf) folder. The terraform module supports deployment to `kind` clusters.

Our preferred approach to secrets is sealed-secrets (have a look at [`gen-keys.sh`](./tools/gen-keys.sh) in case you'd like to use `sops` instead).

If using github, you may want to disable github actions and/or add a public deployment key.

```
gh repo deploy-key add ...
```

In the root folder (w/o terraform), you should be checking

```
make -n argocd-helm-install-basic argocd-apply-root
```

Run this without `-n` once you feel confident to get the ball rolling.

The default `local` deployment will deploy a [SealedSecret](./apps/infra/private/). It will fail during decryption, because we won't be sharing our key. It is meant to be used with Argo Notifications, so it is not critical for a basic demo. Feel free to introduce your own bootstrap secret.

We want lifecycle of things (Create/Destroy) to be as fast as possible. Pulling images can slow things down significantly. Contrary docker a host based solution (such as `k3s`), challenges are harder with `kind`. Make sure to understand your the defails of your painpoints before implementing your solution.

- [Local Registry](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/local-registry/)
- [Pull-through Docker registry on Kind clusters](https://maelvls.dev/docker-proxy-registry-kind/) (`registry:2` supports only one registry per instnance)
- `kind load` may address some use cases
- Remove everything in `kind` installed by Argo CD (so we can rebuild from cached images). (s. `make argocd-destroy`)
